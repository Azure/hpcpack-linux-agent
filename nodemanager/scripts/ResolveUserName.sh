#!/bin/bash

## Introduction:
## This script is used to compose right runas user for HPC nodemanager to run
## job with sudo -E -u <composedUserName> <commands>
##
## By default, HPC will strip domainName and only use userName passed from
## HPC Windows HeadNode as runas user, this is intend to support Linux 
## environment without domain joined.
##
## When it's in an Active Directly integrated Linux environment, 
## it's necessary to compose right runas user with different settings, 
## such as: 'winbind seperator' set in /etc/samba/smb.conf for Winbind
## or 're_expression' set in /etc/sssd/sssd.conf for SSSD.
## to ensure right user is used when HPC run jobs.
##
## In this case, we need compose runas user, for example:
## composedUserName="$domainName.$userName" when Winbind Seperator set to . delimiter
## or In SSSD, when set re_expression = ((?P<domain>.+)\.(?P<name>[^\\\.@]+$))
## and echo back the composedUserName.

## Parameters:
## The 1st parameter passed into this script is the domainName used to submit
## job through HPC. 
## The 2nd parameter passed into this script is the userName used to submit
## job through HPC.


[ -z "$1" ] && echo "domainName not specified" && exit 202
[ -z "$2" ] && echo "userName not specified" && exit 202

domainName="$1"
userName="$2"

## Examples:
#composedUserName="$domainName.$userName", when . set as delimiter
#composedUserName="$domainName\$userName", when \ set as delimiter
composedUserName="$userName"

## To verify if composedUserName exists, comment out these lines if 
## performance is the first priority or it's in non AD integrated environment. 
## Be sure you do compose in the right way.
